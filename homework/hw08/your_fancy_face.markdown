Draw a face using turtle. For example, you can draw the look of disapproval!

![look of disapproval](http://foureyes.github.io/csci-ua.0002-summer2017-001/resources/img/turtle/your_face.png)

Requirements
-----

* you can draw whatever face you like
* but you have to use the turtle module
    * change the size of the pen 
    * set the window size to 400 x 400
    * turn animation off (for sanity's sake)
* create a function called draw_face ... it's up to you to decide if it should have parameters or not (it's ok if you don't parametrize it, but it may be helpful for extra credit)
    * your function will draw a face
    * use at least one circle
    * use at least one line
    * remember to call update at the end of your function to let Python know to _repaint_ the screen
* call your function at the end of your program
