count_not_spaces.py
=====

1.  Create a function called count_spaces:

    * takes one argument, a string
    * it returns the number of characters that are not spaces (' ')
      within that string

2.  Create at least two assertions to test your function.  Make sure to
    test for the following conditions:

    * if there are only spaces, the function should return 0
    * if there are characters other than space, the function should
      return the number of of those characters

3.  Lastly, call your function once at the end of your program:

    * call the function with the string, "A stitch in time saves nine"
    * assign the result of your function call to a variable
	* print out the variable
