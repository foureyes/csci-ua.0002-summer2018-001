Write a function that converts a word into "1337" speak. Use
assertions to test your function.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet

We'll use a simple variant that follows these rules:
-----
* the vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', and 'O', regardless of case will be converted into
  the numbers '/\\', '3', '1', '0' (this should only print out with one
  back-slash)
* all other letters are converted to uppercase
* punctuation and spacing are left as is
* empty string returns empty string

Use assertions to test the following:
-----
* an empty string should give back a string
* "androids inside!  do not enter!" should give back:
  "/\\NDR01DS 1NS1D3!  D0 N0T 3NT3R!"
* "aeioAEIO" should give back: "/\\310/\\310" (this should only print
  out with one backslash each)
* add any other tests that you think are appropriate

Output
-----
* finally (after the asserts), create a variable called result
* assign the result of calling your function on the string:
  "An amazing assignment."
* print out the variable, result

"IPO"
-----
* parameters: takes a string to be converted as an input
* body: substitute letters according to the rules above
* return value: returns the 1337 speak version of the original string

Hints:
-----
* one way to do this is by building a new string
    * start with an empty string
    * accumulate letters into that string
    * use conditionals to determine whether or not a substitution
      should  take place
    * a is a special case, as its substitution consists of two
      characters
    * one of those characters requires an escape sequence (remember
      strings from earlier in the semester?), which is why there are
      two backslashes in a row
* another way to do this is to continue call replace
