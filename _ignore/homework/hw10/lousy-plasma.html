  <aside>This assignment is based on materials from Professors Case, Engel, and Kapp</aside>

  <p>Write a program that takes the <a href="http://genius.com/Taylor-swift-bad-blood-lyrics">lyrics to Taylor Swift&#39;s song</a>, Bad Blood, and replaces a half of its words with synonyms. With enough of the song changed, you can create your own hit song and roll in the money! 	&#128176;&#128176;&#128176;</p>

  <p>The last parts of this assignment depend on a <a href="thesaurus.txt">thesaurus file</a> and a <a href="bad_blood.txt">lyrics file</a> that you&#39;ll have to download (right-click and save as&#8230;) to the same directory that your program is in.</p>

  <p>This assignment will cover recent material on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>dictionaries</li>
    <li>file i/o</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2 id="part-0">Part 0</h2>

  <p>Start off with creating a thesaurus by using a Python dictionary. The thesaurus only has 2 entries in it:</p>

  <pre><code data-trim="" contenteditable="">thesaurus = { 
    "happy": "glad",
    "sad"  : "bleak" 
}</code></pre>

  <p>The dictionary contains two keys - <code>"happy"</code> and <code>"sad"</code>. Each of these keys holds a single synonym, a string, for that key.</p>

  <p>Write a program that asks the user for a phrase. Then compare the words in that phrase to the keys in the thesaurus. If the key can be found, you should replace the original word with a random synonym for that word. Words that are changed in this way should be printed in UPPERCASE letters. Make sure to <strong>remove all punctuation</strong>, but <strong>keep letters/numbers and spaces</strong> from your initial phrase so that you can find all possible matches (numbers probably don&#39;t matter that much, though). Here&#39;s a sample running of your program:</p>

  <p><strong>Example Interaction</strong></p>

  <pre><code data-trim="" contenteditable="">Enter a phrase
&gt; Happy Birthday! exclaimed the sad, sad kitten
GLAD birthday exclaimed the BLEAK BLEAK kitten</code></pre>

  <p>Notice that the 1st sad was substituted, and the comma was removed.</p>

  <p><strong>Hints</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Removing punctuation and keeping letters, numbers and spaces
      <ul>
        <li>One way to do this is to accumulate all of the characters that are alphanumeric (<code>my_character.isalnum()</code>) or space</li>
        <li>While it&#39;s not required, it might be useful to move this functionality into a separate function (maybe call it <code>remove_punctuation</code> &#8230; have it take a string and return a new string</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Breaking apart a string into single words
      <ul>
        <li>Multiples ways of doing this</li>
        <li>Here are a couple of suggestions:
          <ul>
            <li>Accumulate until you see space, then you know you have a word</li>
            <li><strong>OR</strong> simply use <code>split</code>, and then <code>join</code> at the end</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>

  <p>Modify your program above so that the thesaurus word can have more than one synonym for each word:</p>

  <pre><code data-trim="" contenteditable="">thesaurus = { 
    "happy":["glad",  "blissful", "ecstatic", "at ease"], 
    "sad":["bleak", "blue", "depressed"] 
}</code></pre>

  <p>In this version, the dictionary contains two keys - <code>"happy"</code> and <code>"sad"</code>. Each of these keys holds a list that contains synonyms of that key.</p>

  <p>Change your original program by replacing the original word with a <strong>random</strong> synonym for that word. Again, words that are changed in this way should be printed in UPPERCASE letters. Here&#39;s a sample running of your program:</p>

  <p><strong>Example Interaction</strong></p>

  <pre><code data-trim="" contenteditable="">Enter a phrase
&gt; Happy Birthday! exclaimed the sad, sad kitten
ECSTATIC birthday exclaimed the DEPRESSED BLEAK kitten</code></pre>

  <hr />

  <h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>

  <p>Rather than use a hard-coded dictionary as your thesaurus, use an <a href="thesaurus.txt">external thesaurus file</a> (right-click and save as&#8230; <strong>to where your Python program is</strong>) to populate the keys and values in your dictionary. Use the following line to read in your file (do not use absolute paths):</p>

  <pre><code data-trim="" contenteditable="">f = open('thesaurus.txt', 'r') </code></pre>

  <p>The data in the file is in the following format:</p>

  <pre><code data-trim="" contenteditable="">word1,synonym1,synonym2,...,synonymN-1,synonymN
word2,synonym1,synonym2,...,synonymN-1,synonymN
word3,synonym1,synonym2,...,synonymN-1,synonymN</code></pre>

  <p>Every word occupies its own line followed by a comma-separated list of synonyms. Every word can have a potentially unlimited # of synonyms. Your task for this part is to open this file and parse it into a Python dictionary object so that it functions just like the simple thesaurus from the previous part. Here&#39;s a sample running of your program:</p>

  <p><strong>Example Interaction</strong></p>

  <pre><code data-trim="" contenteditable="">Enter a phrase
&gt; happy birthday said the sad kitten
CONTENT ANNUAL HOLIDAY PRONOUNCED the DOLOROUS CHESHIRE CAT</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Hints</strong></p>

  <p>Generating the thesaurus will be the trickiest part:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>For each word in the thesaurus you will need to create a new list that contains all of the synonyms for that word.</li>
    <li>You can then store this list in the dictionary using the 1st word as the key.</li>
    <li>Again, <code>split</code> is incredibly helpful here!</li>
  </ol>

  <hr />

  <h2 id="part-3">Part 3</h2>

  <p>Finally, modify your above program to write a song for you. It&#39;ll use another external file, the <a href="bad_blood.txt">lyrics to Taylor Swift&#39;s Bad Blood</a>, as a source for lyrics.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Download the <a href="bad_blood.txt">lyrics to Bad Blood</a> (right-click and save as to the same directory that your program is in)</li>
    <li>Instead of asking the user for a phrase&#8230; open the lyrics file (bad_blood.txt), and read the entire contents as a string using <code>file_object.read()</code></li>
    <li>Using the same algorithm that you used in the previous program, change the words in the song to a random word from the thesaurus
      <ul>
        <li>you&#39;ll have to lean out all punctuation again, and only keep letters/numbers and spaces</li>
        <li>break apart into single words</li>
        <li>substitute with a random word from thesaurus</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>However, only do this in 1 out of every 2 words that are found in the thesaurus&#8230;
      <ul>
        <li>that is, if you a word from the lyrics is found in the thesaurus</li>
        <li>there is a 50% chance that it will be substituted with the thesaurus word</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Again, words that are swapped should be printed in all UPPERCASE letters.</li>
    <li>Print out the new lyrics!</li>
    <li>Profit!!!</li>
  </ol>

  <p>See a sample running of the program below (note that you can simply remove all punctuation from the lyrics once you&#39;ve read them in from the source file):</p>

  <p><strong>Example Output</strong></p>

  <pre><code data-trim="" contenteditable="">Cause baby now we got DISAPPROBATION blood
You know it use to be mad love
So PLEASURABLENESS a ATTENTION SOCIALITY what youve done
Cause INFANT now we got bad blood ...</code></pre>

  <hr />

  <h2 id="optional-part-4">(Optional) Part 4</h2>

  <p>If you&#39;re on OSX, you won&#39;t even have to sing the lyrics that you <em>&quot;wrote&quot;</em>! Instead, you can have the computer sing it for you. Use the following lines of code at the end of your programming, substituting the variable <code>lyrics</code> with your own variable that contains lyrics:</p>

  <pre><code data-trim="" contenteditable=""># lyrics is the variable that contains the new lyrics to your song
from os import system
system("say -i -v Fiona " + "\"" + lyrics + "\"")</code></pre>
