  <p><strong>lyrics.py</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>this was ambiguous, so I mostly gave full credit</li>
    <li>I expected multline string / bunch of prints / newlines</li>
    <li>I got concatenation, variables, etc</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>mad_lib_lyrics.py</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>this was just string concatenation with variables</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>exercises.py</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>8 was tricky (and confusing) - 2PM, 51 hours later</li>
    <li>add 51 to the 24 hour clock at 2&#8230; use mod</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>tree.py</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>I hoped you would create your own</li>
    <li>your penalty for just copying mine was dealing with backslashes (how?)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="some-meta">Some Meta</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>received <strong>28</strong> out of <strong>34</strong> assignments</li>
    <li>(<strong>2</strong> via <strong>email</strong>, but I won&#39;t judge!)</li>
    <li>the <strong>average score</strong> of the submitted homeworks was <strong>16.89</strong></li>
    <li>high was <strong>18</strong></li>
    <li>low was <strong>10</strong></li>
    <li>grades will be posted after office hours</li>
    <li>I&#39;ll get in touch with you if I&#39;m missing your assignment, or if your score was below math.floor(average)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>most exercises are going to be around <strong>5 points</strong> (give or take a couple)</li>
    <li>by default, you get <strong>2 points</strong> just for handing something in that has no syntax errors! (nice!)</li>
    <li>each additional point after that is for implementing the specified features of the program</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="how-does-this-grading-thing-work">How Does This Grading Thing Work?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>our grader, Vincent and I break down the scores for each file prior to grading</li>
    <li>Vincent goes through all of the assignments on blackboard, as well as the assignments I forward to him via email</li>
    <li>he gives me a summary of scores and comments where points are taken off</li>
    <li>he also flags assignments that I should take a closer look at</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="ok--great-so-what-did-you-do">OK.  Great, So What Did <em>You</em> Do?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>I read through Vincent&#39;s grades and comments</li>
    <li>I take a look at the flagged assignments (for example, he noticed that a lot people were confused by lyrics.py)</li>
    <li>I read all of the comments that you send me (somehow they arrive through text files)</li>
    <li>I run a random sampling (well, in this one, I ran all of the tree programs!)</li>
    <li>I always look at homework that you send me questions about</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="homework-policy">Homework Policy</h3>

  <p>Remember the <a href="../../#homework">posted homework policy</a>; I&#39;m actually following that!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>due one week after posting</li>
    <li>minor penalty each week it&#39;s late (up to 3 weeks)</li>
    <li>homework is a <a href="../../#grading">quarter of your grade</a>
      <ul>
        <li>it should be an easy 25%; you have tutors and myself as resources</li>
        <li>so, please, turn &#39;em in!</li>
        <li>(btw, homework 2 is looking grim for submission rate)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="well-by-following-i-mean">Well, By <em>Following</em>, I Mean&#8230;</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>because of the holidays&#8230;</li>
    <li>and because you&#39;re getting acclimated to how this class works&#8230;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I&#39;ll accept both <strong>homework one and two without any penalties</strong> up through <strong>October 4th</strong></p>

  <h3 id="some-of-this-stuff-is-difficult">Some of This Stuff Is Difficult</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>ask lots of questions in class</strong></li>
    <li>work with the <strong>tutors</strong></li>
    <li><strong>ask me</strong> questions (after class, office hours, email)</li>
    <li>use all of the resources available to you (the internets!)</li>
    <li>I definitely encourage helping each other out, but let&#39;s define what that means&#8230;</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h3 id="a-quick-work-on-collaboration">A Quick Work on Collaboration</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>by default, the page on <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity">academic integrity</a> says that students are supposed to do all assignment individually, without collaboration</li>
    <li>I expect that everyone&#39;s aware of this</li>
    <li>it&#39;s a bit <em>rigid</em>, though, so I don&#39;t mind loosening it up a bit:
      <ul>
        <li>by all means, talk about concepts, syntax etc.</li>
        <li>help each other debug programs!  sometimes you need a second set of eyes</li>
        <li>talk through potential solutions; algorithms are hard (<a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002892.html">let&#39;s go shopping</a>)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3 id="write-your-own-code">Write Your Own Code!</h3>

  <p>With that said, though, <strong>write your own code</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>don&#39;t just copy and paste code and change variable names</li>
    <li>from the web, your peers or tutors</li>
  </ul>
